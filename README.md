## What is AnimalIndex?
If you are like me and remember playing pokemon and used a Pokedex then you may like this simple script I wrote in python to find different animals! 

Using the request module AnimalIndex will check if the animal you have enter is real or not. 
You can also check what countrys have what animals or if you are intrested in learning all the animals by alphabetical order you can search every animal by letter too!
